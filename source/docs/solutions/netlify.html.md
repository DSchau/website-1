# Github/Bitbucket + Netlify

Netlify is a super-easy service that lets you build and host your static website in a couple of simple step and almost no configuration. Please refer to the [Netlify docs](https://www.netlify.com/docs) to learn how you can publish your static website with their service.

## Configuring DatoCMS integration

* Once you have created a Netlify project pointing to the Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab repository of your website, go to the **Deployment Settings** present in the **Admin Area** of your site, and select Netlify as deployment option;
* The system will ask for your Netlify credentials: once the authorization process succeeds, a list of your Netlify projects will be presented;
* Once selected the correct Netlify project, DatoCMS will take care of automatically setting up the connections for you.
