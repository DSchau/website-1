title: DatoCMS for Jekyll - CMS for Jekyll
---

## Jekyll

We have released an easy CLI tool that lets you import content stored within a DatoCMS backend into your Jekyll website. You can follow a [step-by-step tutorial on our Github page](https://github.com/datocms/ruby-datocms-client/blob/master/docs/dato-cli.md).

### Website example

To make it easier to bootstrap your site with DatoCMS, we've prepared a sample website:

* Website deployed to Netlify: [https://datocms-jekyll-example.netlify.com/](https://datocms-jekyll-example.netlify.com/)
* Github repository: [https://github.com/datocms/jekyll-example](https://github.com/datocms/jekyll-example)
