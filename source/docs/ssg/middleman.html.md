## Middleman

DatoCMS currently supports a [Middleman extension](https://github.com/datocms/middleman-dato) which makes it super-easy to use the data present in your site within your Middleman website. Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/datocms/middleman-dato) of the gem for more information.

### Website example

To make it easier to bootstrap your site with DatoCMS, we've prepared a sample website:

* Website deployed to Netlify: [https://datocms-middleman-example.netlify.com/](https://datocms-middleman-example.netlify.com/)
* Github repository: [https://github.com/datocms/middleman-example](https://github.com/datocms/middleman-example)
