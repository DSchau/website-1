      .pricing-faqs__item__answer
        p
          ' No, it's not. You can use the free plan as long as you want without
          ' credit cards. Just be aware that if you reach the free plan limits
          ' in a site and your Account is not associated with a credit card,
          ' your editors won't be able to add new content to their website until
          ' you do it.

      .pricing-faqs__item__question What do you mean with "record"?
      .pricing-faqs__item__answer
        p
          ' A record represents a single piece of information you store within a
          ' site. Think of it like a database-like entry. It can be anything: a
          ' blog post, a category, an image gallery, a staff member in your about page.
          ' Within each site, you can configure the specific fields required for
          ' each kind of record.

      .pricing-faqs__item__question What is a site?
      .pricing-faqs__item__answer
        p
          ' Every website you manage with DatoCMS needs a separate site. Each
          ' site is completely isolated from the others, with different data
          ' and editors, and is accessible from a different domain. You can manage
          ' your sites from your Account dashboard.
