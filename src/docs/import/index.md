title: Importing data

If you're coming from Wordpress or Contentful, we released some specific tools that require no coding at all:

* [Importing data from Wordpress](/blog/wordpress-importer/)
* [Importing data from Contentful](/blog/from-contentful-to-datocms/)

If you want to import content from other sources, you can still use our [Content Management API](/content-management-api/) to programmatically create any object in DatoCMS â€” models, fields, records, etc. 

Here you can learn how to use our API clients to create content into DatoCMS:

* [Importing data using DatoCMS NodeJS API client](/docs/import/nodejs/)
* [Importing data using DatoCMS Ruby API client](/docs/import/ruby/)
