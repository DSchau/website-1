title: How DatoCMS works
---

DatoCMS is a cloud-based content management system designed to work with static websites, mobile apps and server-side applications of any kind. Freelancers, agencies and startups use DatoCMS to allow non-technical clients and team members to manage the content of their digital products within a web-based CMS.

Once you signup to DatoCMS and create your account, you'll be able to create an arbitrary number of different projects. For each one of those you'll be given an administrative area at a specific domain (ie. https://my-project.admin.datocms.com) from which you'll be able to invite a number collaborators to manage its specific content. All the projects you create will be completely isolated from each other.

DatoCMS provides a content infrastructure that comprises two different APIs for working with your content. Each of these APIs serve a different purpose, so which one to use depends on what you want to do:

* If you're retrieving content to display to users in an app or website, use the [Content Delivery API](/docs/content-delivery-api/).
* If you want to programmatically create or update content items, use the [Content Management API](/content-management-api/).
