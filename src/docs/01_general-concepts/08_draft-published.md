title: Draft/published system
---

You can decide to activate the draft/published system on a per-model basis:

![foo](../images/versioning/activate.png)

If you do so:

* When you create a new record, it will be put into a *Draft* status. This means that the record is still not published: you can continue making changes and saving the record without having to worry about showing unfinished content to your end users. 

* Once you're satisfied with the changes, you can click on the *Publish* button: the latest revision of your record will be marked as the *Published version*, and it will be instantly available in the DatoCMS API. 

* If you make a change to a published record, its status will be become **Updated**. Again, those changes won't be visible to end users and published until you explicitly click on the *Publish* button again.
