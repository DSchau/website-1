title: Localization
---

Each administrative area in DatoCMS supports multiple locales, defined by the short ISO locale codes (ie. `en` or `de`). You can add or remove locales within the *Admin area > Site settings* section:

![Site settings in admin area](../images/localization/1.png)
![Available languages select](../images/localization/2.png)

Each field is localized individually, so you can pick and choose which specific content needs to be translated and which not:

![Field-specific localization](../images/localization/3.png)
![Field localization switch](../images/localization/4.png)

As soon as a localized field is present within a model, the form to edit its records will present one tab for each locale:

## Optional or required locales?

**To be written.**
