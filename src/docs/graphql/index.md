DatoCMS offers a single GraphQL endpoint:

```
https://graphql.datocms.com/
```

The endpoint remains constant no matter what operation you perform, and it's read only â€” that is, it does not offer any *mutation operation*. You can use our [REST API](/api/) for that.

#### API Explorer

To see what queries are available in your schema you can use our [API Explorer](https://graphql.datocms.com/graphiql). Type your GraphQL query in the left-most text box and then press Play button:

#### Preview endpoint

If you have the [Draft/Published system](/docs/introduction/versioning/#draftpublished-system) active on some of your models, you can use a different endpoint to access records at their latest version available, instead of the currently published: this can be useful on staging environments, or your local development machine:

```
https://graphql.datocms.com/preview
```

#### Authenticating

To communicate with the GraphQL server, you'll need a read-only API token. You can find your API token in the *Admin area > API tokens* section of your administrative area:

![foo](../images/api-token.png)

Both endpoints offer exactly the same queries, the only thing that will change will be the returned content.

#### Rate limits

API Rate limits specify the number of requests a client can make to DatoCMS APIs in a specific time frame. Since this API is meant to be used for delivering content from DatoCMS to apps, websites and other media, every site with a paying plan offers no limits on requests that hit our CDN.

#### Communicating with GraphQL

In REST, HTTP verbs determine the operation performed. In GraphQL, you'll provide a JSON-encoded body even if you're performing a query operation, so the HTTP verb is always `POST`.

```bash
$ curl 'https://site-api.datocms.com/graphql' \
    -H 'Authorization: YOUR-API-TOKEN' \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    --data-binary '{ "query": "query { allPosts { title } }" }'
```
