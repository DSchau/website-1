### Overview

DatoCMS offers a Ruby-based CLI tool that makes it extremely convenient to transform the content stored in your administrative area into local:

* Jekyll [posts](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) and [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) (complete with YAML frontmatter);
* Jekyll [data files](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/datafiles/).

Once content coming from DatoCMS is dumped into local files, you are free to use Jekyll just like you're used to. You are in charge of specifing how DatoCMS records will be dumped into these files using a Ruby config file called `dato.config.rb`.
