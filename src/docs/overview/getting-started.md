When you signup to DatoCMS, you'll be able to create and manage an arbitrary number of static websites. It's important to understand that **every website you create is totally isolated from the others**:

* each website is editable from an administrative area located at a specific domain (ie. https://my-website.admin.datocms.com);
* each website can invite a different set of editors to manage the content;
* within each administrative area you will be able to manage different kind of content, structured following each website needs, and data will be saved in a separate database;

This is particularly handy for agencies, which will be able to manage multiple websites for different clients within a single account, generating a single, cumulative invoice.
